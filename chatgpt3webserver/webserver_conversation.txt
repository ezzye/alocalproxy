give me the python code for a web server with sign up and login

Here is an example of a simple Python web server with sign up and login functionality using the Flask web framework:

This code uses the Flask web framework to create a simple server that listens for HTTP requests and responds with HTML pages. It also uses SQLAlchemy, a Python library for interacting with databases, to store user information in a SQLite database.

The signup route handles the sign up form submission and adds the new user to the database. The login route handles the login form submission and checks the provided credentials against the database to see if the user exists. If the user exists, it redirects the user to the home page. If the user does not exist, it redirects them back to the login page.

This is just one example of how you could implement a web server with sign up and login functionality in Python. There are many other ways to do it, and you may want to customize this code to fit your specific needs.
